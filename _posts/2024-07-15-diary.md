Now I am at Split in Croatia. It is so hot!!!

I am still super tierd and actually since I am now staying in the shared room I cannot be fully relaxed. To be honest, it's a bit stressfull, though I am on the other hand happy to see my friends.
I realized now many people got interested in the field-level stuff, so it's better to wrap up the paper ASAP...

I have noticed this since long ago, but everytime I join this kind of conference/workshop I am remined that I am socially-inept...

In the flight I watch DUNE part I. It was good than expected, while everything that happend in the movie is a kind of all expected.
