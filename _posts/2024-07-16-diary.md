Basically due to the jet lag, here I am living a healthy life.

This afternoon we had the excurtion to Hvar. Hiking to the castle and visiting the monaster(in particular, the courtyard was good) was a fun, though at the same time it was a desaster. TOO HOT!!! 
I should have brought a swimming costume.
